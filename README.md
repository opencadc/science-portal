# CANFAR Science Portal

A modern web application providing a user interface for the [CANFAR](https://www.canfar.net/) (Canadian Advanced Network for Astronomical Research) platform. Science Portal enables researchers to access and manage JupyterLab notebooks, CARTA, Desktop (VNC), and other interactive sessions backed by CANFAR resources.

Platform load information is available, including current CPU usage and counts of running instances.

## Description

This CANFAR service provides the ability to access and manage Jupyter notebook, desktop (VNC), and CARTA sessions that back onto CANFAR resources. Using container images and current system resource values (context) provided by [Skaha](https://ws-uv.canfar.net/skaha), you can launch and manage sessions using the container image you select. Contextualization is provided for some session types, allowing the amount of memory, number of cores, and GPU resources you designate to power your session.

## Features

- **Session Management** - Launch, monitor, renew, and delete computational sessions
- **Container Applications** - Access JupyterLab notebooks, CARTA, Desktop (VNC), and other research tools
- **Resource Selection** - Configure memory, CPU cores, and GPU resources with interactive controls
- **Platform Monitoring** - Real-time metrics for platform load and resource usage
- **Storage Management** - View and manage user storage quota
- **Session Logs & Events** - View logs and events for running sessions
- **Dual Authentication** - Supports both CANFAR and OIDC authentication modes
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-friendly interface with light/dark theme support

## Endpoint Locations

All endpoints require authentication with CANFAR, and authorization to access Skaha resource allocations.

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Science Portal | https://www.canfar.net/science-portal |
| Skaha Web Service | https://ws-uv.canfar.net/skaha |

### OIDC Configuration

Science Portal supports OpenID Connect in the Next.js app (NextAuth). For registering URIs at your identity provider and for environment variables, see **[Deploying with OIDC](#deploying-with-oidc-openid-connect)** under Deployment below and [.env.example](.env.example). Older servlet-based deployments may still document `oidc` settings in [org.opencadc.science-portal.properties](./org.opencadc.science-portal.properties).

## User Workflows

All workflows assume you are logged in with a CADC account.

## Deployment

### Docker

Build the production image (standalone Node server on port 3000):

```bash
docker build -t science-portal .
```

Run a minimal container. The app is served under **`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`** (defaults to `/science-portal` in the `Dockerfile`), so open **http://localhost:3000/science-portal** unless you use an empty base path at build time.

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e AUTH_SECRET='replace-with-a-long-random-string' \
  -e NEXT_USE_CANFAR=true \
  -e LOGIN_API='https://ws-cadc.canfar.net/ac' \
  -e SKAHA_API='https://ws-uv.canfar.net/skaha' \
  -e SERVICE_STORAGE_API='https://ws-uv.canfar.net/arc/nodes/home/' \
  science-portal
```

Adjust the three API URLs for your environment. For **OIDC** mode, follow [Deploying with OIDC](#deploying-with-oidc-openid-connect) below instead of the CANFAR URLs above.

You can also use Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Example compose files that wire OIDC env vars include [docker-compose.oidc.example.yml](./docker-compose.oidc.example.yml).

#### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

The workflow [`.github/workflows/ci-build.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci-build.yml) builds the Docker image on every push to `main` (and on manual dispatch) without uploading it.

Publishing a **[GitHub Release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)** does the following in order:

1. Pushes the container image to **[Harbor](https://goharbor.io/)** with two tags (the Git release tag, e.g. `2.1.3`, plus `latest`).
2. Sets **`helm/Chart.yaml`** `version` and **`appVersion`** to that same release tag semantically (bare SemVer, no `v` prefix).
3. Points **`helm/values.yaml`** default **`image.repository`** / **`image.tag`** at the Harbor image pushed in step 1 (`HARBOR_REGISTRY` + `HARBOR_REPOSITORY`).
4. Runs **`helm lint`**, packages the chart, and **`helm push … oci://`** to Harbor (same hostname; see below).

Packaging applies only inside the Actions runner—it does **not** commit Helm file updates back to the branch. Maintain `helm/` in git separately if you want the repo defaults to mirror each release.

**Actions variables**, under *Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions*:

| Name | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| `HARBOR_REGISTRY` | Hostname only, e.g. `harbor.example.org` |
| `HARBOR_REPOSITORY` | Image path inside the registry, e.g. `platform/science-portal` |
| `HARBOR_HELM_OCI_REPOSITORY` _(optional)_ | Harbor **project** segment in `helm push … oci://${HARBOR_REGISTRY}/\<project>`; if unset, the job uses the substring before the first **`/`** in `HARBOR_REPOSITORY` |

**Secrets:** `HARBOR_USERNAME`, `HARBOR_PASSWORD` (Harbor robot account or equivalent).

Patching logic lives in [.github/scripts/patch-helm-release.py](.github/scripts/patch-helm-release.py). Use **bare SemVer** Git release tags (for example **`2.1.3`** or **`2.0.0-rc.1`**); they become **`Chart.yaml` `version`**, **`appVersion`**, and **`values.yaml` `image.tag`**, so `version` must stay valid for `helm package`.

### Deploying with OIDC (OpenID Connect)

Use OIDC mode when **`NEXT_USE_CANFAR=false`** and **`NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_CANFAR=false`**. Supply **`AUTH_SECRET`** and set **`NEXTAUTH_URL`** to the public URL visitors use for this deployment (scheme, host, and non-default port if any). Behind a reverse proxy that terminates TLS, set **`AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true`** (or **`AUTH_URL`**) so redirects and cookie security match HTTPS; align this with `.env.example` comments.

Define your IdP (**`NEXT_OIDC_URI`**, **`NEXT_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`**, **`NEXT_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`**, **`NEXT_OIDC_SCOPE`**) plus the mirrored **`NEXT_PUBLIC_OIDC_*`** values for client-side discovery. OIDC-backed deployments normally use **`SRC_SKAHA_API`** / **`SRC_CAVERN_API`** instead of CANFAR `LOGIN_API`/`SKAHA_API`—see [.env.example](.env.example).

#### Callback and redirect URIs

Naming in this codebase:

- **Redirect URI** (`NEXT_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI`) — OAuth 2 authorization-code **`redirect_uri`**. Sent to the IdP and handled by Auth.js / NextAuth at **`/api/auth/callback/oidc`**. This value **must exactly match** an allowed redirect URI in your IdP registration (often called “Redirect URIs”, “Valid redirect URIs”, or callback URLs).

- **Callback URI** (`NEXT_OIDC_CALLBACK_URI` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_OIDC_CALLBACK_URI`) — The portal’s **public landing URL** for this build (usually the UI root). It is required in configuration and must match how users reach the app; register it too if your IdP asks for origins, post-login URLs, or CORS/Web origins separately.

Express both using your public **origin** (no trailing path beyond what you need for the host) plus **`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`** (empty for root deployments, otherwise e.g. `/science-portal`):

| Concept | Typical URL |
| --------|---------------|
| **Register with IdP as OAuth redirect** | `{ORIGIN}{BASE}/api/auth/callback/oidc` |
| **Set redirect env vars to** | same as the row above |
| **Set callback env vars to** | `{ORIGIN}{BASE}` (portal entry; optionally with a trailing `/` consistent with how you expose the app) |

Here `{ORIGIN}` is whatever you effectively use as the site URL (e.g. `https://www.canfar.net` or `http://localhost:3000`), and **`{BASE}`** is **`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`** with no duplicate slashes when concatenating.

**Examples:**

- Production-style host with base path: `ORIGIN=https://www.canfar.net`, `BASE=/science-portal` → register and set **`https://www.canfar.net/science-portal/api/auth/callback/oidc`**; set callback env vars to **`https://www.canfar.net/science-portal`**.

- **`npm run dev`** on port `3000` with no base path: register **`http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/oidc`**; set callback vars to **`http://localhost:3000/`** (see [.env.example](.env.example) for the exact defaults your team prefers).

Never omit **`{BASE}`** from the OAuth path when **`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`** is set; browsers invoke NextAuth at **`{BASE}/api/auth/*`**.

### Kubernetes

Helm charts are provided for Kubernetes deployment. See the [Helm documentation](./helm/README.md) for detailed instructions.
